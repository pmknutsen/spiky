DESCRIPTION
The application is essentially a GUI wrap-around for the Chronux (http://www.chronux.or) spike sorting routines. In addition, Spiky! has a number of useful features for streamlining the process of spike sorting, visualizing data and analysing spike trains and field potentials.

REQUIREMENTS
Basic requirements are Matlab 6.5 and higher. The software has been tested to run well on Matlab in a Windows or Linux environment (Mac not tested but should work fine as well).


FEATURES
 - 1-Click automatic spike sorting 
 - Import behavioral data 
 - PSTH, cross-correlations, power spectral densitities 
 - On-the-fly automatic sorting of directories 
 - and more...


INSTALLATION
Download and unzip the current distribution (.zip) file featured at:
http://code.google.com/p/spiky/

Copy the unpacked folder to a location on your system. In Matlab, add the folder with all sub-folders to the path. Type spiky to start the application.
